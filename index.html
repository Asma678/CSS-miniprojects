            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style sheets</li>

            <li>CSS description how html elements are to be display on screen,paper or in other media</li>

            <li id="p1">External stylesheets are stored in CSS file</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="first">CSS can be added in HTML documents in three way:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
           <li>Internal- by using inline element in the head section
            <li>External- by using link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the style in external CSS file. However,<span class="one"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier<br>for you to try it yourself</li>
           </ul>
        <p>
            when comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple element. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by javascript
            <br><br>
            In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. once an elements has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
            <br><br>
            There is a wide range of  Selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
